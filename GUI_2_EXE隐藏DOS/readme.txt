This program will hide the command window of compiled programs for all versions of Microsoft Windows.  To use, change the name in the "suppress.ini" file to the name of your MATLAB EXE file, then run "suppress.exe".  You may rename "suppress.exe", but you may not rename "suppress.ini" without editing and recompiling the source code.  The files "suppress.exe", "suppress.ini", and your EXE file must all be in the same directory.  This utility was created using NSIS (http://nsis.sf.net/).  The default settings will run the "test.exe" program included in the ZIP file.
